# opencode-web

A web-based user interface for [opencode](https://github.com/sst/opencode), providing a modern chat interface to interact with AI coding agents.

## Features

- **Real-time chat interface** with AI coding agents
- **Live streaming responses** via SDK event subscription
- **Tool execution display** with enhanced diff viewing for code changes
- **Model selection** from multiple AI providers
- **Responsive design** for desktop and mobile
- **Auto-session creation** for immediate use

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (recommended) or Node.js 18+
- Running [opencode](https://github.com/sst/opencode) API server

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/opencode-ui.git
cd opencode-ui

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start opencode server
cd /path/to/your-project
opencode serve

# Start development server
bun dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Configuration

The app will auto-detect your opencode API server. If running on a different host/port, configure the API endpoint in your environment.

## Development

### Available Scripts

- `bun dev` - Start development server with hot reload
- `bun run build` - Build for production
- `bun run lint` - Run ESLint
- `bun run preview` - Preview production build

### Tech Stack

- **React 19** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for build tooling
- **@opencode-ai/sdk** for API integration
- **CSS Modules** for styling
