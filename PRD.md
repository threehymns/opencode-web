# Product Requirements Document: opencode-ui

## Overview

**Product Name**: opencode-ui  
**Version**: MVP 1.0  
**Date**: July 2025  
**Team**: opencode Development Team

## Executive Summary

opencode-ui is a web-based user interface that provides a chat-like interface to interact with the opencode API. The MVP will replicate the core functionality of the existing Terminal User Interface (TUI) in a modern, accessible web application.

## Problem Statement

Users need a web-based alternative to the command-line opencode TUI that provides:
- Easy access without terminal knowledge
- Better accessibility and user experience
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Shareable sessions via web links

## Target Audience

**Primary Users**:
- Developers who prefer GUI over CLI
- Teams collaborating on code projects
- Users on restricted environments where CLI access is limited

**Secondary Users**:
- Non-technical stakeholders reviewing AI-assisted code changes
- Educational users learning to code with AI assistance

## Product Goals

### Primary Goals
1. Provide feature parity with opencode TUI for core chat functionality
2. Enable seamless session management and sharing
3. Deliver real-time AI conversation experience
4. Support multiple AI providers and models

### Secondary Goals
1. Improve accessibility over CLI interface
2. Enable better collaboration through web sharing
3. Provide foundation for future advanced features

## MVP Feature Requirements

### Core Features

#### 1. Single Session Chat
- **Auto-create session** on app initialization via `client.session.create()`
- **Send messages** via `client.session.prompt()`
- **Stream responses** via `client.event.subscribe()` for real-time updates
- **Support for basic message types**:
  - Text parts (user input and AI responses)
  - Tool invocations with results (display only)

#### 2. Provider & Model Selection
- **Provider listing** via `client.config.providers()`
- **Simple model dropdown** for session
- **Use default provider/model** if none selected

#### 3. Real-time Updates
- **EventSource/SSE connection** for live message streaming
- **Message part updates** as AI responds
- **Basic typing indicators** during AI response

### User Interface Requirements

#### Layout
- **Single-pane chat interface** - full width
- **Simple, clean design** focused on conversation
- **Mobile-friendly responsive** layout

#### Chat Interface
- **Message bubbles** with user/assistant distinction
- **Tool execution display** (collapsed by default) with specific rendering:
  - **Edit tool**: Enhanced diff viewer component
  - **Read tool**: File preview with syntax highlighting (post-MVP)
  - **Other tools**: Raw codeblock output (bash, list, glob, grep, webfetch, todo)
- **Real-time status updates** showing specific tool execution progress
- **Typing indicators** during AI response
- **Auto-scroll** to latest message
- **Message input** with send button

### Technical Requirements

#### Frontend
- **React 19** with TypeScript
- **Real-time communication** via EventSource or WebSocket
- **State management** for sessions and messages
- **Responsive CSS** framework
- **Error handling** for API failures

#### API Integration
- **Full OpenAPI spec compliance**
- **Event streaming** implementation
- **File upload/download** support
- **Authentication** (if required)

#### Performance
- **Message virtualization** for large conversations
- **Lazy loading** of session history
- **Optimistic UI updates**
- **Offline state handling**

## User Stories

### Core Chat Experience
- As a user, I want to send a message and see the AI response stream in real-time
- As a user, I want to see when AI is using tools so I understand what's happening
- As a user, I want a simple, focused chat interface without distractions

### Configuration
- As a user, I want to select an AI model from a dropdown
- As a user, I want the app to work with sensible defaults if I don't configure anything

## Success Metrics

### MVP Success Criteria
- **Functional parity** with TUI core features
- **Sub-2 second** message response time
- **99% uptime** for web interface
- **Cross-browser compatibility** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### User Experience Metrics
- **Session completion rate** > 80%
- **Average session duration** > 5 minutes
- **User retention** after first session > 60%

## Technical Constraints

### API Limitations
- Must work within existing opencode API structure
- Real-time updates dependent on event streaming
- File operations limited to API capabilities

### Browser Support
- Modern browsers with ES2022 support
- WebSocket/EventSource support required
- Local storage for session persistence

## Future Considerations

### Post-MVP Features
- **Session management** (create, list, switch, delete)
- **Session sharing** and collaboration
- **File operations** and search
- **Enhanced tool result displays**:
  - Interactive directory tree (list/glob results)
  - Clickable search results (grep results)
  - Rich command output (bash results)
  - Web content preview (webfetch results)
  - Interactive todo management (todo results)
  - Image viewer (for image file operations)
  - Tool execution timeline for multi-step operations
- **Reasoning display** for supported models
- **Session persistence** and history

### Scalability
- **Multi-user support** with authentication
- **Team workspaces** and permissions
- **Session templates** and automation
- **Integration** with IDEs and other tools

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- opencode API server running and accessible
- AI provider API keys configured
- Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled

### Internal Dependencies
- React 19 and TypeScript setup
- Build and deployment pipeline
- Error monitoring and logging

## Timeline

### Phase 1: Core Chat (Week 1)
- Project setup and API client
- Auto-session creation
- Basic message send/receive

### Phase 2: Real-time Streaming (Week 2)
- Event streaming implementation
- Message part updates
- Tool execution display

### Phase 3: Polish (Week 3)
- UI improvements and responsive design
- Error handling
- Model selection dropdown

## Risks & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Event streaming complexity**: Start with polling fallback
- **Large message handling**: Implement virtualization early
- **API rate limits**: Add proper error handling and retry logic

### User Experience Risks
- **Learning curve**: Provide onboarding and help documentation
- **Performance on large sessions**: Implement pagination and lazy loading
- **Browser compatibility**: Test early and often across browsers

## Tool Result Display Strategy

### MVP Implementation
The MVP will use a centralized `ToolResultDisplay` component that handles all tool result rendering:

```typescript
const ToolResultDisplay = ({ toolInvocation, metadata }) => {
  // Enhanced display for edit tool only
  if (toolInvocation.toolName === 'edit' && metadata.diff) {
    return <DiffViewer diff={metadata.diff} filename={metadata.title} />
  }
  
  // All other tools: simple codeblock
  return (
    <pre className="tool-output">
      <code>{toolInvocation.result}</code>
    </pre>
  )
}
```

### Tool Categories by Implementation Priority

**MVP: Enhanced Display (High Value)**
- `edit` tool → DiffViewer component (unified diff format)

**MVP: Raw Codeblock (Simple)**
- `read` tool → Plain text with line numbers
- `bash` tool → Command output
- `list`/`glob` tools → Directory listings
- `grep` tool → Search results
- `webfetch` tool → Web content
- `todo` tools → Task lists

**Post-MVP: Rich Components**
- Interactive directory trees
- Clickable search results with file navigation
- Syntax-highlighted file previews
- Command output with execution metadata
- Web content with proper formatting
- Interactive todo management

### Status Message Enhancement
Real-time status updates show specific tool execution progress:
- "Waiting for response..." (initial wait only)
- "Reading file..." / "Editing file..." / "Running command..." (specific tools)
- "✓ Reading file completed" (completion feedback)
- "✓ Completed 3 tools - Generating response..." (overall progress)

## Conclusion

The opencode-ui MVP will provide a solid foundation for web-based AI-assisted coding, replicating the core TUI functionality while laying groundwork for future enhancements. The tool result display strategy balances immediate value (diff viewing) with implementation simplicity (codeblocks for other tools). Success will be measured by functional parity, performance, and user adoption.
